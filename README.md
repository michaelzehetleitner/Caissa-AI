## Motivation
Caïssa is an approach that provides reasoning and understanding of the chess move. It transmits information represented in the knowledge base in Prolog to nodes and edges as a knowledge graph in Neo4j that can be queried directly to retrieve structured information from the knowledge graph. This information advocates the reasoning behind the suggested move. This allows to build dynamic ontologies as a solution where static ontologies would fail, since small variances between chessboards can have an enormous difference in the information represented in the ontology. By leveraging the capabilities of combining both a large model called Gemini and the existing knowledge in Neo4j using LangChain, Caïssa is capable of creating chess commentary based on user input related to piece positions and relations between pieces on a chessboard and providing a move commentary. Caïssa also utilizes a newly introduced library called LangGraph to implement a verification module that acts as a guard to prevent any incorrectly generated commentary where the results obtained from the system almost contain no hallucinations. This prototype can be scaled to be a software solution that assists in teaching beginners chess rules and tactics, where existing solutions either provide a basic explanation or statistical representation that does not help a beginner understand the reason behind a chess move.

## Architecture
### Caïssa's Architecture
As an approach for creating a system capable of generating chess commentary and diminishes the amount of hallucination. Caïssa grounds LLM, which is Gemini with the built knowledge graphs in Neo4j, which result in the construction of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enhances the outcome of large language model (LLM) based on the facts stored in the knowledge graph in Neo4j.

Caïssa utilizes LangChain that allow to create agents from Large Language Models such as Gemini and specify the purpose of each agent using Prompt Engineering by specifying its role and context and giving it examples of how to perform its task. The process of providing chess commentary is the following:
1. User clicks on the toggle button to use Gemini and sends a request from the browser using Next.js with a query in natural language.
2. The request is handled at the backend using APIs in Flask, which contains an instance of the chess commentary agent.
3. The agent is configured with tools that allow it to use other agents by forming chains for a specific type of question, such as for questions that are related to chess pieces position and moves, it would use GraphCypherQAChain from LangChain to generate a Cypher query that can be executed and retrieve a structured response that is sent to the main agent to transform it back to natural language, or if the query is about tactics, it would use the basic neurosymbolic module and summarise its answer.
4. In both cases, the retrieved answer, either from sub-agent or from the neurosymbolic module, is sent back to the user in the body of the response to the request made in the browser.

### Example
Let’s call the first agent “the conductor” which is a person who directs the performance of an orchestra as it orchestrate what module to use based on the user question and what information to pass to the modules.

In the following, more explanation will be provided for step number 4 in the process. After the conductor receives a question from the user, it determines which tool
to pick. The options are the GraphCypherQA Chain tool, responsible for generating Cypher queries and executing them to retrieve an answer usable by the conductor for generating chess commentary, or the Chess Solver Chain tool, which utilizes a neurosymbolic module to provide a chess move suggestion from [ChessGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09200) and its corresponding tactic.

If the conductor choses the GraphCypherQA Chain tool then it is capable of grounding LLM based on the context stored in the knowledge graph in Neo4j, built using Prolog, to derive the correct response to a user query.

### Final Architecure Overview
Even though progress was made in providing chess commentary with logical correctness, challenges were encountered. Obstacles arose as the model did not consistently
generate answers for the same prompt. Responses varied from full answers to partial ones, or no answer at all with the statement that it did not know the answer. Additionally, efforts were made to minimise hallucination, achieved by prompting the LLM to provide answers based on information in the knowledge graph in Neo4j. However, there is still a risk of hallucination, as LLM (the conductor) may deviate from the prompt and provide an answer from its knowledge. To mitigate this, the whole architecture of Caïssa was modified by adding the verifier module as an attempt to solve this problem using LangGraph.

<img src="images/caïssa_overall_architecture.png" alt="Caïssa Final Architecture Image" align="center" style="margin: 10px;"/>

LangGraph enables the coordination of multiple agents across numerous steps of computation in a cyclic manner. The verifier module consists of two phases after receiving the chess commentary from the chess commentary agent and the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) representation of the chessboard.

#### First Phase
1. The verifier agent determines the type of the commentary.
2. Based on the type of commentary determined by the verifier agent, a corresponding module would be executed to validate the chess commentary

<img src="images/verifier_arch.png" alt="Verifier Module Phase 1 Image" align="center" style="margin: 10px;"/>

#### Second Phase
Every module follows a number of steps, utilising tiny agents to perform various tasks. The overall process is as follows:
1. **Tiny Agent 1**: The main purpose of this agent is to split chess commentary into multiple simple statements to process them later on by the rest of the agents in the pipeline. The chess commentary can sometimes be complex, involving multiple pieces of information about various chess pieces.
2. **Tiny Agent 2**: This agent is utilising the KOR library, which is a wrapper over the LLM, to retrieve structured data from the LLM, which constructs a JSON representation of every statement received from the previous agent.
3. **Symbolic Module**: This module either utilises a knowledge base in Prolog or a knowledge graph in Neo4j to execute queries based on the data included in the JSON format of every statement. Moreover, this module filters out any incorrect information from the chess commentary and outputs the correct statements and include any missing information in the chess commentary, such as position or the color of a piece.
4. **Tiny Agent 3**: This agent receives the output of the previous symbolic module and augments the missing information in each statement.

## Tactics & Concepts
### Tactics
The following table demonstrate tactics that are supported by basic Caïssa.

**Tactic**  | **Definition**
------------- | -------------
**Fork**  | A fork occurs when an ally piece can threat two or more pieces at the same time.
**Discover attack**  | A discover attack occurs when an ally piece is moved such that it allows another ally piece to attack opponent’s piece that was previously blocked.
**Discover check** | A discover check occurs when an ally piece is moved such that it allows another ally piece to check the opponent’s king.
**Skewer** | A skewer occurs when two opponent pieces are aligned such that an ally piece causes a threat to the more valuable opponent piece, where the move of the more valuable piece would result in the capture of the less or equal valuable opponent piece by the same ally piece.
**Relative pin** | A relative pin occurs when a less valuable opponent piece is aligned with a more valuable opponent piece, such that if the less valuable opponent piece moved, it would cause the more valuable opponent piece to be captured.
**Absolute pin** | An absolute pin occurs when an opponent piece is aligned with the opponent king such that if the opponent piece moved, it would cause the king to be checked.
**Hanging piece** | A hanging piece is an opponent piece that can be captured and there is no other opponent piece that can defend it.
**Mate in one** | A mate in one occurs when there is a single move that would cause the opponent to be checkmated.
**Mate in two** | A mate in two occurs when there are two moves that would cause the opponent to be checkmated.
**Interference** | An interference occurs when there is a move that interferes between opponent pieces where one of the pieces defends the other piece.

### Concepts
The following table demonstrate concepts that are supported by both basic and reinforced Caïssa.

**Concept**  | **Definition**
------------- | -------------
**Defend** | Whether a piece can defend or protect the ally piece directly.
**Threat** | Whether an opponent piece such that piece can attack or threat the opponent directly.
**Move defend** | A move made by a piece from its current position to new position to defend an ally piece on a third different position.
**Move is protected** | A move made by a piece from its current position to new position and it is protected by an ally piece on a third different position at the new position.
**Move threat** | A move made by a piece from its current position to new position to attack an opponent piece on a third different position.
**Move is attacked** | A move made by a piece from its current position to new position and it is attacked by an opponent piece on a third different position at the new position.

    ```
    cd ..
    ```

### 4. Start the Application:
  * Run the application using:
    ```
    ./start.exe
    ```

### 5. Run the Flask API Directly
If you want to exercise the REST endpoints (for example `/reinforced_chatbot`) without launching the desktop wrapper:

1. Create/activate a virtual environment in the repo root (reusing `.venv` is recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r server/requirements.txt
   ```
2. Export the paths expected by the server:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)"
   export KB_PATH="$(pwd)/server/neurosymbolicAI/symbolicAI/general.pl"
   ```
3. Make sure the environment variables for Neo4j (`NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USERNAME`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`) and OpenAI/Gemini/Groq keys are resolvable via `.streamlit/secrets.toml` or your shell.
4. Run the API:
   ```bash
   python -m server.server
   ```
   The server will be available on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

> [!TIP]
> The neuro-symbolic module automatically downloads the `Waterhorse/chessgpt-chat-v1` model from Hugging Face on first run. Ensure the machine can reach `https://huggingface.co` or pre-populate your `HF_HOME`/`HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE` directories with that model if you need an offline workflow. Similarly, the GraphCypher tool requires a reachable Neo4j instance; if the database is unavailable the server will still start, but graph-backed commentary tools will raise a clear error the first time they are invoked.

## :warning: Note
- Caïssa requires lots of computational power, so it tends to run slowly on older devices.
- To chat with Caïssa you need to toggle the button first.
- Caïssa is still in its prototype stage and could be improved with additional logic to fully grasp all aspects of a chess game, ultimately becoming a comprehensive tool to assist chess beginners.

> [!CAUTION]
> Although the verifier module was added to Caïssa to reduce the occurrence of hallucinations, it can still make mistakes.
