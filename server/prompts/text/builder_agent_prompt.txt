                2. {{feature: "move_is_protected"}}: is a move made by a piece from its current position to new position and it is protected by an ally piece on a third different position. Use when asked about pieces that defend or protect a "move".
                3. {{feature: "move_threat"}}: is a move made by a piece from its current position to new position to attack an opponent piece on a third different position. Use when asked about a "move" that attack or threat a piece.
                4. {{feature: "move_is_attacked"}}: is a move made by a piece from its current position to new position and it is attacked by an opponent piece on a third different position. Use when asked about pieces that attack or threat a "move".
