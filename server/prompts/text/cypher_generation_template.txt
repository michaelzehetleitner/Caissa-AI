Use the following when assigning values to relationship's Properties:
    - Piece: {{piece: "", color: "", position: ""}}
    - Suggest: {{tactic: "threat"}}, {{tactic: "defend"}}, {{tactic: "fork"}}, {{tactic: "interference"}}, {{tactic: "mate"}}, {{tactic: "mateIn1"}}, {{tactic: "mateIn2"}}, {{tactic: "discoveredAttack"}}, {{tactic: "skewer"}}, {{tactic: "hangingPiece"}}, {{tactic: "pin"}}
    - Feature: {{feature: "move_is_attacked", piece: "", color: "", position: ""}}, {{feature: "move_defend", piece: "", color: "", position: ""}}, {{feature: "move_is_protected", piece: "", color: "", position: ""}} and {{feature: "move_threat", piece: "", color: "", position: ""}}

Use the following step-by-step process:
    1. Determine what are the pieces in the question which must be from the following list: [bishop, pawn, rook, king, queen, knight]
    2. Determine the color of the pieces in the question which must be from the following list: [white, black]
    3. Determine the postion of the piece in the question which is UCI format.
    4. Determine the correct relationshio in the question which is either a Suggest or Feature or Locate.
    5. Determine the correct property to use based on the following:
        a. If the question contain only "threat" word with no "move" word:
            - Please use the Suggest relationship with property {{tactic: "threat"}} in your Cypher Query only as in the Example 2.
        b. If the question contains only "defend" word with no "move" word:
            - Please use the Suggest relationship with property {{tactic: "defend"}} in your Cypher Query only as in the Example 1.
        c. If the question contains word "threat" or "attack" with a "move" word:
            - If the question is about an opponent (black or white) piece that attack a move then use the Feature relationship with property {{feature: "move_is_attacked"}}  as in the Example 4.
            - If the question is about an opponent (black or white) piece that is attacked by a move then use the Feature relationship with property {{feature: "move_threat"}} as in the Example 8.
        d. If the question contains word "defend" or "protect" with a "move" word:
            - If the question is about an ally (black or white) piece that defend or protect a move then use the Feature relationship with property {{feature: "move_is_protected"}} as in the Example 7.
            - If the question is about an ally (black or white) piece that is defended or protected by a move then use the Feature relationship with property {{feature: "move_defend"}} as in the Example 6.
        e. If the question is about position of the piece or the square that piece is located on then use Locate relationship as in Example 3.
    5. Generate a Cypher query from the Examples.
    6. Return the 'context' value from the result of Execution of Cypher Query even if the provided information does not need to mention anything about the question.
    
# Please follow the following output format: {{'context': [{{'p2.piece': 'queen', 'p2.color': 'white', 's2.position': 'e4'}}]}}
    Example: {{'query': 'What black pieces protect the black rook move from f8 to f3 {{piece}}: rook {{color}}: black {{old position}}: f8 {{next move}}: f3 {{opponent}}: {{relation}}: move_is_protected', 'result': "I don't know the answer.", {{'context': [{{'p1_old_pos': 'f8', 'p1_new_pos': 'f3', 'p2.piece': 'knight', 'p2.color': 'black', 's2.position': 'd4'}}]}}]}}
    Output: {{'context': [{{'p1_old_pos': 'f8', 'p1_new_pos': 'f3', 'p2.piece': 'knight', 'p2.color': 'black', 's2.position': 'd4'}}]}}

# Notes
    1. Please use "Feature" relationship when Questions is contains the word "move".
    2. NO piece with same position and color have a relationship with ITSELF!
    3. ONLY use color, piece, relations in the provided Schema!
    4. Use relationship Locate for location or position.
    5. Schema used is case sensitive, so please you must always lowercase values for properties such as "defend" NOT "Defends" or "DEFEND"!
    6. FOCUS ON THE ORDER in The Difference between "move_is_protected" and "move_defend" is that "move_is_protected" for a move that is protected by ally piece while "move_defend" for a move that protects an ally piece.
    7. FOCUS ON THE ORDER in The Difference between "move_is_attacked" and "move_threat" is that "move_is_attacked" for a move that is attacked by opponent piece while "move_threat" for a move that attack an opponent piece after the move.
    8. FOCUS that you understand relationship in the question carefully either based on Feature or Suggest.
    9. IF FULL CONTEXT is not empty YOU MUST USE it!
    10. ONLY USE the relation provided in the Action Input. please do not use any other relation!
    11. `result` MUST be based on the Full Context
    12. {{color}} and {{position}} MUST be based on the input ONLY!!!

Use Neo4j 5 Cypher syntax.  When checking a property is not null, use `IS NOT NULL`.
