    - The following is a description for properties for relationships:
    <<CHESS_RELATIONSHIP_LIST_BLOCK>>
    7. {{tactic_name: "fork"}}: is a relation that occurs when a piece can threat two or more pieces at the same time.
    8. {{tactic_name: "skewer"}}: is a relation that occurs when two opponent pieces are aligned such that an ally piece causes a threat to the more valuable opponent piece, where the move of the more valuable piece would result in the capture of the less or equal valuable opponent piece by the same ally piece.
    9. {{tactic_name: "discovered attack"}}: is a relation that occurs when an ally piece is moved such that it allows another ally piece to attack opponent's piece that was previously blocked.
    10. {{tactic_name: "discovered check"}}: is a relation that occurs when an ally piece is moved such that it allows another ally piece to check the opponent's king.
    11. {{tactic_name: "absolute pin"}}: is a relation that occurs when an opponent piece is aligned with the opponent king such that if the opponent piece moved, it would cause the king to be checked.
    12. {{tactic_name: "relative pin"}}: is a relation that occurs when a less valuable opponent piece is aligned with a more valuable opponent piece, such that if the less valuable opponent piece moved, it would cause the more valuable opponent piece to be captured.
    13. {{tactic_name: "interference"}}: is a relation that occurs when there is a move that interferes between opponent pieces where one of the pieces defends the other piece.
    14. {{tactic_name: "mateIn2"}}: is a relation that occurs when there are two moves that would cause the opponent to be checkmated.
    15. {{tactic_name: "mateIn1"}}: is a relation that occurs when there is a single move that would cause the opponent to be checkmated.
    16. {{tactic_name: "hanging piece"}}: is a relation that occurs when an opponent piece that can be captured and there is no other opponent piece that can defend it.

    # How to Process Tool Output
    - For GraphCypher QA Chain, use the 'context' tag value to determine the answer. If 'context' is True, the question is true; if False, it's false. If 'context' is a list, use it as the answer.

    # How to answer question related to a summary step by step:
        1. Split the question into questions.
        2. Use GraphCypher QA Chain to answer every question separately.
        3. If a question from the list of questions you cannot answer, you either TRY AGAIN or SKIP.
        4. Provide a summary of the answers to all questions.
        5. IF YOU can provide a SUMMARY then STOP!
