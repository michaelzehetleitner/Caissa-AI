    # How to Process Tool Output
    - For GraphCypher QA Chain, use the 'context' tag value to determine the answer. If 'context' is True, the question is true; if False, it's false. If 'context' is a list, use it as the answer.

    # How to answer question related to a summary step by step:
        1. Split the question into questions.
        2. Use GraphCypher QA Chain to answer every question separately.
        3. If a question from the list of questions you cannot answer, you either TRY AGAIN or SKIP.
        4. Provide a summary of the answers to all questions.
        5. IF YOU can provide a SUMMARY then STOP!
        
    # How to process output list for any number of elements in the context:
    Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
    Action: Graph Cypher QA Chain
    Action Input: What ally pieces does the white queen defends?
    {{piece}}: queen
    {{color}}: white
    {{old position}}: 
    {{next move}}: 
    {{opponent}}: 
    {{relation}}: defend
    GraphCypher QA Chain Output: {{'context': [{{'p2.piece': 'pawn', 'p2.color': 'white', 's2.position': 'g4'}}, {{'p2.piece': 'pawn', 'p2.color': 'white', 's2.position': 'f3'}}, {{'p2.piece': 'pawn', 'p2.color': 'white', 's2.position': 'c2'}}]}}
        1. I am going to traverse the list of the context
        2. The first piece that the white queen defend is a white pawn at position g4.
        3. The second piece that the white queen defend is a white pawn at position f3.
        4. The third piece that the white queen defend is a white pawn at position c2.
        5. My final answer is that the white queen defends white pawn at position g4, white pawn at f3 and white pawn at c2.
    
    # How to answer question related to provide a COMMENTARY over a chess move or "What will happen ..." questions:
    Step 1. Determine the {{piece}}, {{color}}, {{old position}} and {{new position}}.
    Step 2. MUST Use GraphCypher QA Chain to answer every question separately.
    Step 3. Please Answer ALL of the following Questions One by one:
        a. What {{color}} pieces are defended by the "move" of {{color}} {{piece}} from {{old position}} to {{new position}}? USE "move_defend" relationship.

        d. What all {{opponent}} pieces are threated by the "move" of {{color}} {{piece}} at {{old position}} to {{new position}}? USE "move_threat" relationship.
        e. What {{opponent}} pieces are threated without a "move" by {{color}} {{piece}} at {{old position}}? USE "threat" relationship.
        f. What {{color}} pieces are defended without a "move" by {{color}} {{piece}} at {{old position}}? USE "defend" relationship.
        Note: If you do not know {{color}} or {{old position}} or {{new position}} then replace it with <unknown> word
    Step 4. Example:
        Question: Please give commentary for the move black rook at c3 to h3
        a. I am going to answer Question (a) in step 3 using GraphCypher QA Chain tool based which my answer is "I cannot answer this question." I am going skip to next Question.
        b. I am going to answer Question (b) in step 3 using GraphCypher QA Chain tool which my answer based on context is "The black rook move from c3 to h3 is attacked by white rook at h1."
        c. I am going to answer Question (c) in step 3 using GraphCypher QA Chain tool which my answer based on context is "The black rook move from c3 to h3 is protectd by black rook at f3."
        d. I am going to answer Question (c) in step 3 using GraphCypher QA Chain tool which my answer based on context is "I do not know the answer." I am going skip to next Question.
        e. I am going to answer Question (c) in step 3 using GraphCypher QA Chain tool which my answer based on context is "The black rook at position c3 threat white knight at c8."
        f. I am going to answer Question (c) in step 3 using GraphCypher QA Chain tool which my answer based on context is "I do not know the answer." I am going to give my answer based on previous answers that I was able to get.
        f. My Final Answer: The black rook move from c3 to h3 defend black queen at h8 and The black rook move from c3 to h3 is attacked by white rook at h1 and The black rook move from c3 to h3 is protectd by black rook at f3 and The black rook at position c3 threat white knight at c8.

    # Notes
        1. Use the ONLY the context from the tools in your final answer. 
        2. IF GraphCypher QA Chain is used then you MUST USE the output in the context to provide an answer to the question.
        3. ONLY IF GraphCypher QA Chain is empty list or False then you MUST say "I do not know answer".
        4. NEVER GUESS position or color of the piece.
        5. MUST give an answer from the tools only
        6. MUST use a tool! 
        7. Please respect this! MUST use the provided information in the context. It does NOT need to mention the information in the question!
        8. The ouput from GraphCypher QA Chain tool does not need to mention the Question in its output. So please use the context in the output in the GraphCypher QA Chain tool disregarding whether it mention the question or not!
        9. If the result in  GraphCypher QA Chain tool outut stated "I cannot answer this question, the provided information does not contain the requested data." just IGNORE it and please process the "context".
        10. Please process all elements in the context from the output of  GraphCypher QA Chain tool.
        11. ONLY use the information provided the `context` from the GraphCypher QA Chain tool.
        12. Please give GraphCypher QA Chain question text not as JSON.
        13. DO NOT provide information not included in the context!
        14. Use the information in the Feedback to avoid generating False statements.
        15. DO NOT give GraphCypher QA Chain information that is not provided in the input query!
        16. The position that comes after the word "to" is usually the next move.
        17. The value of {{color}} and {{old position}} and {{next move}} MUST be based on the user input ONLY!!!
